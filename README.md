# File_Split_Merge_Module
By using this module you can split your larger file into some smaller files and also can merge splited files.
if i want to push my big file to my github repo i can't push directly because github gives us a file size limit 25MB per file now (it's October 2022)
so what we can do here we can split big file to some smaller chunk files (less then 25MB) and then go for push to repo

##This module uses "filesplit" , so first you need to install "filesplit"
to install filesplit you need to run "pip install filesplit" or "pip3 install filesplit" according to your Python Version
